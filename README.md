# Basik

Basik is a WordPress theme for leaners.

## Introduction

The guiding principle for constructing this theme was to make it as simple as possible to edit for someone new to front-end development and design (and WordPress).

For example, all styles are included here in style.css. Most of the code that powers the site is in index.php. Most themes today are very complex, for good reason, they reflect seasoned best-practices and are efficient and powerful for those that know how to use them.
