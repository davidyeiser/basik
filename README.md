# Basik

Basik is a WordPress theme for learners.

### Introduction

Most themes today are very complex. And for good reason, they reflect seasoned best-practices and are efficient and powerful for those that know how to use them. But what makes them efficient for a professional makes them confusing and frustrating for a novice.

Hence, the guiding principle for constructing this theme was to make editing the theme as simple as possible for someone new to front-end development and design (and WordPress). All the styles are included in `style.css` and most of the code that powers the site is in `index.php`.

It’s a complete and functioning theme, but it’s very bare bones when it comes to features. It includes functionality for WordPress’s Nav Menus but other than that it’s mainly title, publish date and content.

### Design

[IBM’s Plex Serif](https://github.com/ibm/type) is used for body copy and IBM Plex Mono for monospace. Elsewhere the system sans serif typeface is used.

### License

The theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) with the exception of IBM’s Plex fonts, those are under the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).
